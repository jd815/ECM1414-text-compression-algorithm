HUFFMAN CODING
This is the ECM1414 compression coursework.
When you run the program it will ask you if you want to compress or decompress.
If you choose compress it will also ask you what file you want to compress. All the files I have used
are in the folder so you can choose any of those or add some more as long as they are in the same folder.
If you choose decompress, it will decompress whatever is in the output_file.bin which is the last book
that was compressed. All of the books used were obtained from https://www.gutenberg.org/ and the
repetitive corpus datasets from http://pizzachili.dcc.uchile.cl/repcorpus.html
